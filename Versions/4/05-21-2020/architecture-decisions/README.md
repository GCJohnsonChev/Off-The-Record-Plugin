## Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains Architecture Decision Records written using the template
from
[documenting architecture decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
These documents keep track for the reasons for some design decisions of OTRv4.

In summary, in each ADR file, write these sections:

- **Title**: short present tense imperative phrase, less than 50 characters,
  like a git commit message.
- **Context**: what is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this
  decision or change.
- **Decision**: what is the change that we're actually proposing or doing.
- **Status**: (only use while the work is in progress) proposed, accepted,
  rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.
- **Consequences**: what becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this
  change.
